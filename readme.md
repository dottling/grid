## The App

There are 2 ways to save points to the cartesian plane:

- Click on the cartesian plane where you want to draw a point;<br>
- Add the points manually through the form entries:
  - The points must be separated by comma, without any spaces between them. Eg.: `1.6,2.1,3.4`;
  - The same amount of points should be submitted for the X-axis and Y-axis. Eg.: `1.6,2.1,3.4` and `5,7.3,9.8`;
  - In the example above, the following pairs will be drawn:
    - `(1.6, 5)`
    - `(2.1, 7.3)`
    - `(3.4, 9.8)`
